    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with 
        crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 
        for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. 
        I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the 
        kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, 
        so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>
