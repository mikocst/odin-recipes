<h1>Homemade Smash Burger Recipe</h1>
<a href="recipes/recipename.html">Smash Burger Recipe</a>
<img src="./images/SmashBurger.webp">
<p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with 
    crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 
    for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. 
    I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the 
    kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, 
    so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Hamburger Buns</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares of parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices of American Cheese</li>
        <li>Burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat outdoor grill and lightly oil
            the grate. Set a cast iron onto the grill to
            preheat until smoking.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Spread butter on the inside
            of the buns and toast the flat-top until lightly browned
            then set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Form meat into 8 loosely
            packed balls which weigh up to 2 ounces each. Place
            each ball on top of the pan and cover with parchment
            paper. Smash down the meat and sprinkle the meat with
            salt.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Grill for 45 seconds until
            the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light
            pink color. Grill for another 15-20 seconds and stack
            the patties over cheese. Move each stack to a bun with
            your favorite toppings.
        </li>

    </ol>
